Overview

This project involves the development of a comprehensive solution for analyzing news data, building machine learning components, and implementing MLOps practices. The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Task 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing**
   - In this task, we analyze and preprocess news data to extract meaningful insights and prepare it for further analysis and modeling.

2. **Task 2: Data Science Component Building and MLOps**
   - Task 2 focuses on building various data science components, including data preprocessing, model building, analysis pipelines, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, time series analysis, and unit testing. Additionally, we implement MLOps practices such as model versioning, tracking experiments, and managing ML lifecycle.

3. **Task 3: Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Task 3 involves training machine learning models on the preprocessed data and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics. We also discuss model versioning, model serving, and monitoring practices.

## Task 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing

- **Data Collection**: We collected news data from multiple sources and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's structure, features, and characteristics.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps included cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

- **Feature Engineering**: We engineered new features from the existing data to improve model performance and capture additional information.

## Task 2: Data Science Component Building and MLOps

### Data Science Components:

- **Data Processing**: Implemented data preprocessing and feature engineering steps to prepare the data for modeling.

- **Model Building**: Developed machine learning models, including training, evaluation, and prediction functions.

- **Analysis Pipeline**: Designed an analysis pipeline that incorporates data processing, modeling, and evaluation steps.

- **Topic Modeling**: Implemented topic modeling algorithms to categorize news articles into predefined tags.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implemented sentiment analysis algorithms to determine the sentiment of news articles.

- **Time Series Analysis**: Implemented time series analysis techniques for analyzing trends in news data over time.

### MLOps Practices:

- **Model Versioning**: Versioned ML models and their associated artifacts using MLFlow to track changes and reproduce experiments.

- **Model Serving and Monitoring**: Deployed ML models in production environments and monitored their performance and health.

## Task 3: Model Training and Evaluation

- **Model Selection**: Selected appropriate machine learning models based on the problem domain and data characteristics.

- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessed the data, split it into training and testing sets, and handled feature scaling and encoding.

- **Model Training**: Trained the selected models on the training data using suitable algorithms and hyperparameters.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the trained models' performance using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
