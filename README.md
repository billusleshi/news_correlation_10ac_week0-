Project Documentation: Exploring Global News Data for Sentiment Analysis and Correlation
Introduction:
The project focuses on analyzing a dataset comprising global news articles collected over recent months using the NewsAPI. The primary goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and correlation analysis among various media agencies worldwide. This project serves as part of the evaluation process for candidates applying for the Data Engineering (DE), Generative AI Engineer (AIE), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) training program at 10 Academy.

Contributions:
This documentation outlines the contributions and implementation steps of the project, which include:
